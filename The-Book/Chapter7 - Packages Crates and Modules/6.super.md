Rust allows us to construct relative paths that begin in the parent module, rather than the current module or crate root. In order to do this, we use `super`. Super allows us to reference an item that we know is in the parent module, similar to using `..` in filesystem path syntax. This can make rearranging the module tree easier.

In `restaurant` package, we have now added the code for back of the house. Here we have defined a module `back_of_the_house` (refer to [lib.rs](./projects/restaurant/src/lib.rs)). Back of the house has a function `fix_incorrect_order`, calls `cook order` function and then callse the `deliver_order` function defined outside the module (i.e. in parent module/crate root) by using the `super` keyword.
