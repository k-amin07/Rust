Another solution to bring two different types of the same name into scope is specifying a custom name with the `as` keyword.
This is similar to python where we do something like `import numpy as np`. In Rust, the syntax is
```
use std::fmt::Result;
use std::io::Result as IoResult;

fn function1() -> Result {
    // --snip--
}

fn function2() -> IoResult<()> {
    // --snip--
}

```
Both this and 
```
use std::fmt;
use std::io;

fn function1() -> fmt::Result {
    // --snip--
}

fn function2() -> io::Result<()> {
    // --snip--
}
```
are idiomatic and the choice is up to us.
