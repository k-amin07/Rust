For importing multiple items from the same crate or module, we can do 
```
use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};
```
instead of 
```
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;
```

To import the module itself, as well as some function, we can use the `self` keyword

```
use std::io::{self, Write};
```
This brings both `std::io` and `Write` into scope.

To bring all public items into scope, we can use the `Glob` operator (`*`).
```
use std::collections::*;
```

This is usually done while writing tests.
