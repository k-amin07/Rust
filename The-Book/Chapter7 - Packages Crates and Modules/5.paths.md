Just like with navigation in a file system, we need to tell rust where to find an item in the module tree. To call a function, we need to know its path. A path can take two forms
- **Absolute path:** where we define the path starting from the crate root for example _crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();_.
- **Relative Path:** where we define the path relative to the current module. Here we can use _self_, _super_ or an identifier in the current module, for example _front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();_ if
    ```
    mod front_of_the_house {
        mod hosting {
            fn add_to_waitlist(){}
        }
    }
    ```
    is defined within the same file.

For example,
```
mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

Choosing when to use the relative or absolute path depends on the project. This above code throws a compile time error that the module `hosting` is private. To fix this, we can define hosting as public, as well as the `add_to_waitlist()` function. Declaring only the mdoule public will not make its contents public.

Note that the compiler does not throw error an error on `front_of_house` not being public. This is because `fn eat_at_restaurant()` is a sibling of `mod front_of_the_house`.
