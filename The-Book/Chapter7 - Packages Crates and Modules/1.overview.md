- A package can contain multiple binary crates and optionally one library crate. As the package grows, its parts can be extracted into separate crates that become external dependencies.
- Cargo also provides Workspaces for very large projects, which are discussed in Chapter 14.
- The chapter also discusses encapsulating implementation details which lets us reuse code at a higher level.
- A related concept is scope. The nested context in which the code is written has a set of names that are considered to be in scope. When reading, writing, and compiling code, programmers and compilers need to know whether a particular name at a particular spot refers to a variable, function, struct, enum, module, constant, or other item and what that item means. 
- We can create scopes and change which names are in or out of scope. A scope cannot two items with the same name. Tools are available to resolve name conflicts.

Rust has a number of features that allow us to manage the code organization, including which details are exposed, which are private and which names are in each scope of the program. These features are collectively called the `module system` and they include:
- **Packages:** A cargo feature that lets us build, test and share crates.
- **Crates:** A tree of modules that produce a library or executable.
- **Modules** and **use:** Lets us control the organization, structure and privacy of paths
- **Paths:** A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module.
