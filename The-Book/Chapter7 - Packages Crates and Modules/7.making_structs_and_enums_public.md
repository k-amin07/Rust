We can use the `pub` keyword to make structs and enums public. However, the struct fields will still be private. To make a field public, it must also be declared with `pub` keyword.

In [eat_at_restaurant](./projects/restaurant/src/lib.rs) function, we can read and write the `toast` field of the `meal` using the dot notation. However, since seasonal fruit is private, we cannot directly read or modify it.

Since `back_of_the_house::Breakfast` has a private field, the struct needs to provide a public associated function that constructs `Breakfast` (in this case the `summer` function). If `Breakfast`did not have such a function, we would not be able to construct it since we cannot set the private field. The compiler throws the error

```
field `seasonal_fruit` of struct `Breakfast` is private
  --> src/lib.rs:48:77
   |
48 |     let mut meal = back_of_the_house::Breakfast{toast: String::from("abc"), seasonal_fruit: String::from("def")};
   |                                                                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ private field
```

If we skip the seasonal_fruit here, we get the following error
```
error: cannot construct `Breakfast` with struct literal syntax due to private fields
  --> src/lib.rs:48:20
   |
48 |     let mut meal = back_of_the_house::Breakfast{toast: String::from("abc")};
   |                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |
   = note: ... and other private field `seasonal_fruit` that was not provided
```

In contrast, if we make an enum public, all of its variants also become public. For instance the `Appetizer` enum in [back_of_the_house](./projects/restaurant/src/lib.rs). This is because enums wouldnt be very useful if some of their variants are private and it would be annoying to annotate all enum variants with `pub` in every case. Structs are often useful without their fields being public, so struct fields follow the general rule of everything being private by default unless annotated with `pub`.
