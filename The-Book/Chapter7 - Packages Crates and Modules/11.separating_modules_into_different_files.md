So far, we have defined multiple modules into one file. When modules get large, we might want to move their definitions into separate files.

In the restaurant example, we can do that by first extracting `front_of_house` into its own file. Refer to [restaurant_separate_modules](./projects/restaurant_separate_modules/src/).

In `src/lib.rs`, we have only declared front_of_house and we are using `front_of_house::hosting`

```
mod front_of_house;

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;
```

We have moved the implementation of front_of_house into its own file (`front_of_house.rs`). In that file, we have declared the module `hosting`. We have also created a directory called `front_of_house` which contains `hosting.rs` where the function `add_to_waitlist` is defined.

In other words, we declare a module in its own file and then move its implementation to a directory of the same name.

We do not need to change `pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;` in `src/lib.rs` as Rust knows where to look for the implementation.
