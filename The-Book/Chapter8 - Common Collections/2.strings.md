We have used Strings before. We can convert any type to String, as long as it supports the `Display` trait. `str` is a string literal, usually used as `&str`. We can create a String in various ways, for example

```
let mut s = String::new(); // creates a new empty string

let data = "initial contents"; // string literal, aka string slice.
let s = data.toString(); // creating string from a string literal

let s = "initial contents".toString(); // this also works

let s = String::from("abc"); // another valid way of creating a String.

```

Strings are UTF-8 encoded, which means they support a wide variety of characters. All of the following Strings are valid in Rust

```
    let hello = String::from("السلام عليكم");
    let hello = String::from("Dobrý den");
    let hello = String::from("Hello");
    let hello = String::from("שָׁלוֹם");
    let hello = String::from("नमस्ते");
    let hello = String::from("こんにちは");
    let hello = String::from("안녕하세요");
    let hello = String::from("你好");
    let hello = String::from("Olá");
    let hello = String::from("Здравствуйте");
    let hello = String::from("Hola");
```

### push and push_str

`push_str` method allows us to append another String or string literal/slice to a String. `push_str` accepts a string slice since we do not necessarily want to take ownership of the String. `push` method allows us to push one character only. 

```
let mut s = String::from("foo");
s.push_str("bar");
s.push(';'); // notice single quotes here
```

### + operator and format macro
We can concat Strings using the `+` operator, however, we need to remember the ownership rules

```
let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
let s2 = String::from("world!");
let s3 = s1 + &s2; // note s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used
```
The reason s1 is no longer valid and the reason we had to use a reference to s2 has to do with the `add` method signature, which looks like this
```
fn add(self, s: &str) -> String {
```
Here, the function accepts a reference to a string slice, but the code still compiles since the compiler can _coerce_ the &String argument into a &str. When we call the `add` method, the compiler uses a _deref coercion_, which here turns `&s2` into `&s2[..]`. Because add does not take ownership of the `s` parameter, `s2` is still valid after the add operation. However, since it takes ownership of `self`, s1 is no longer valid.

The format macro, however, can prevent this situation.
```
let s1 = String::from("tic");
let s2 = String::from("tac");
let s3 = String::from("toe");

let s = format!("{s1}-{s2}-{s3}");
```
s1, s2 and s3 are all valid after this line of code executes. `format` macro works just like the `println` macro, but instead of printing something to the screen, it returns the string.

### Indexing into Strings
```
let s1 = String::from("tic");
let h = s1[0]; // will generate a compiler error
```
To reference into Strings, we can do either of the following

1. Obtaining a slice of the String
```
let hello = String::from("Здравствуйте");
let s = &hello[0..4];
```
2. Iterating over the String
```
for c in "Зд".chars() {
    println!("{c}");
}
```

Alternatively, we can use `bytes` method to obtain raw bytes
```
for b in "Зд".bytes() {
    println!("{b}");
}
```
will print
```

208
180
```
