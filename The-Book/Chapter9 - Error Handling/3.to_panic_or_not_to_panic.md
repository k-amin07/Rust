In situations such as examples, prototype code and tests, its more appropriate to write code that panic! instead of returning an error.

There are situations, like examples or tutorials, where error handling code can make the example less clear. 

[unwrap and expect methods](2.recoverable_errors_with_result.md) are handy for prototyping, before we decide how we are going to handle the errors.

If a method call fails in a test, we'd want to fail the whole test, even if the method is not a functionality under test. Test failures are marked by panic, so it is appropriate to use unwrap and expect.

There can also be cases, where we have some logic that ensures that `Result` will always be the `Ok` variant (like some operation on a hard coded value), however, compiler doesnt understand this. In these cases, it is perfectly acceptable to call `unwrap`, and even better to document the reason why this wont ever be an `Err` variant by using `expect`. For example

```
use std::net::IpAddr;
let home: IpAddr = "127.0.0.1"
    .parse()
    .expect("Hardcoded IP address should be valid");
```

Here we have hardcoded the IP address so it will always be valid.
